## How to get the API key and location ID working for WeatherFetcher.js files

- Create an `.env` file (same level as .json and .js files)
- Within the `.env` file write this:

    API_KEY = XXXX
    LOC_ID = 3772

The LOC_ID is hardcoded for now, but once we have the submit button connected to an API, this will change.

API_KEY will be given to you in a non-public way.
